Task(s)
-------
This summative will be in lieu of a quiz/test for the **Files** section of the course.

Run the following program:  **OUT | SEIDEL | ICS3C | FILES SUMMATIVE | runMe.py**
Afterwards, your task is to complete a full analysis of the text file generated in your G drive.

Your analysis should be able to work for **any** generated text file.  The text file will only contain capital letters, lowercase letters, and the newline character (to create separate lines).

Your analysis must include the following:

1. How many vowels there are (a, e, i, o, u): in total, and per line.
2. How many consonants there are: in total, and per line.
3. How many capital vowels there are: in total, and per line.
4. How many capital consonants there are: in total, and per line.
5. How many lowercase vowels there are: in total, and per line.
6. How many lowercase consonants there are: in total, and per line.
7. How many lines of text are included in your text file.
8. How many characters exist per line (all lines are equal) in your text file.

You will also create a visual representation of the text file in multiple ways:

1. You will change every vowel into a space, and every consonant into an 'o' and display the entire text file.
2. You will change every consonant into a space, and every vowel into an 'o' and display the entire text file.
3. You will change every capital letter into a space, and every lowercase letter into an 'o' and display the entire text file.
4. You will change every lowercase letter into a space, and every capital letter into an 'o' and display the entire text file.
